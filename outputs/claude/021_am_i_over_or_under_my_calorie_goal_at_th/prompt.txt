You are a data visualization expert specializing in smartwatch health interfaces. You will be given a single row of personal health data and a user query:

User Query: Am I over or under my calorie goal at the moment

Personal Health Data:
User ID: 1540
Age: 27
Gender: Male
Height (cm): 198
Weight (kg): 70
Workout Type: Running
Workout Duration (mins): 59
Calories Burned: 828
Heart Rate (bpm): 118
Steps Taken: 15530
Distance (km): 5.91
Workout Intensity: Medium
Sleep Hours: 6.9
Water Intake (liters): 1.9
Daily Calories Intake: 3179
Resting Heart Rate (bpm): 62
VO2 Max: 38.4
Body Fat (%): 28.5
Mood Before Workout: Neutral
Mood After Workout: Energized

Your task is to:
1. Determine the most appropriate visualization mode for the insight, choosing from:
   - Donut chart
   - Bar chart  
   - Icon-based chart
   - Text-only with color/icon emphasis

2. Generate a single compact SVG suitable for a smartwatch screen (approximately 360x360 pixels). The SVG must be:
   - Visually clear and glanceable
   - Optimized for small screens
   - Aesthetically pleasing, with components contrasting the background
   - Self-contained (no external styles or dependencies)
   - Labeled with meaningful titles, units, or icons where appropriate
   - In the style of a visual that would be seen on a smartwatch

Focus on the user's perspective: What is most relevant for them to know at a glance right now?

Please respond with only the SVG code, starting with <svg and ending with </svg>.
