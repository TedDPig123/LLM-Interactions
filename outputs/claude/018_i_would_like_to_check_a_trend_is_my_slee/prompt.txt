You are a data visualization expert specializing in smartwatch health interfaces. You will be given a single row of personal health data and a user query:

User Query: I would like to check a trend is my sleep in the past seven days

Personal Health Data:
User ID: 2738
Age: 38
Gender: Male
Height (cm): 194
Weight (kg): 99
Workout Type: Running
Workout Duration (mins): 109
Calories Burned: 303
Heart Rate (bpm): 177
Steps Taken: 2424
Distance (km): 6.32
Workout Intensity: Medium
Sleep Hours: 9.2
Water Intake (liters): 1.9
Daily Calories Intake: 3898
Resting Heart Rate (bpm): 70
VO2 Max: 38.4
Body Fat (%): 28.5
Mood Before Workout: Neutral
Mood After Workout: Fatigued

Your task is to:
1. Determine the most appropriate visualization mode for the insight, choosing from:
   - Donut chart
   - Bar chart  
   - Icon-based chart
   - Text-only with color/icon emphasis

2. Generate a single compact SVG suitable for a smartwatch screen (approximately 360x360 pixels). The SVG must be:
   - Visually clear and glanceable
   - Optimized for small screens
   - Aesthetically pleasing, with components contrasting the background
   - Self-contained (no external styles or dependencies)
   - Labeled with meaningful titles, units, or icons where appropriate
   - In the style of a visual that would be seen on a smartwatch

Focus on the user's perspective: What is most relevant for them to know at a glance right now?

Please respond with only the SVG code, starting with <svg and ending with </svg>.
