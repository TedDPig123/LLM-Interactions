User Query: How many calories that I login for breakfast

Personal Health Data:
User ID: 9299
Age: 31
Gender: Male
Height (cm): 193
Weight (kg): 110
Workout Type: Yoga
Workout Duration (mins): 111
Calories Burned: 664
Heart Rate (bpm): 84
Steps Taken: 7862
Distance (km): 12.17
Workout Intensity: Low
Sleep Hours: 4.3
Water Intake (liters): 1.9
Daily Calories Intake: 2871
Resting Heart Rate (bpm): 70
VO2 Max: 38.4
Body Fat (%): 28.5

Mood After Workout: Neutral

Your task is to:
1. Determine the most appropriate visualization mode for the insight, choosing from:
   - Donut chart
   - Bar chart  
   - Icon-based chart
   - Text-only with color/icon emphasis

2. Generate a single compact SVG suitable for a smartwatch screen (approximately 360x360 pixels). The SVG must be:
   - Visually clear and glanceable
   - Optimized for small screens
   - Aesthetically pleasing, with components contrasting the background
   - Self-contained (no external styles or dependencies)
   - Labeled with meaningful titles, units, or icons where appropriate
   - In the style of a visual that would be seen on a smartwatch

Focus on the user's perspective: What is most relevant for them to know at a glance right now?

Please respond with only the SVG code, starting with <svg and ending with </svg>.
