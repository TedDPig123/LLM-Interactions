You are a data visualization expert specializing in smartwatch health interfaces. You will be given a single row of personal health data and a user query:

User Query: What's my average sleeping time this past week

Personal Health Data:
User ID: 3073
Age: 19
Gender: Other
Height (cm): 156
Weight (kg): 79
Workout Type: Yoga
Workout Duration (mins): 64
Calories Burned: 971
Heart Rate (bpm): 178
Steps Taken: 19298
Distance (km): 11.84
Workout Intensity: Low
Sleep Hours: 8.8
Water Intake (liters): 1.9
Daily Calories Intake: 1624
Resting Heart Rate (bpm): 64
VO2 Max: 38.4
Body Fat (%): 28.5
Mood Before Workout: Tired
Mood After Workout: Energized

Your task is to:
1. Determine the most appropriate visualization mode for the insight, choosing from:
   - Donut chart
   - Bar chart  
   - Icon-based chart
   - Text-only with color/icon emphasis

2. Generate a single compact SVG suitable for a smartwatch screen (approximately 360x360 pixels). The SVG must be:
   - Visually clear and glanceable
   - Optimized for small screens
   - Aesthetically pleasing, with components contrasting the background
   - Self-contained (no external styles or dependencies)
   - Labeled with meaningful titles, units, or icons where appropriate
   - In the style of a visual that would be seen on a smartwatch

Focus on the user's perspective: What is most relevant for them to know at a glance right now?

Please respond with only the SVG code, starting with <svg and ending with </svg>.
