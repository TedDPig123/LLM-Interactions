User Query: How many more minutes of exercise do I need to reach my exercise goal for the day

Personal Health Data:
User ID: 5981
Age: 21
Gender: Other
Height (cm): 179
Weight (kg): 90
Workout Type: Cardio
Workout Duration (mins): 87
Calories Burned: 766
Heart Rate (bpm): 98
Steps Taken: 8374
Distance (km): 2.71
Workout Intensity: Medium
Sleep Hours: 7.8
Water Intake (liters): 1.9
Daily Calories Intake: 2557
Resting Heart Rate (bpm): 86
VO2 Max: 38.4
Body Fat (%): 28.5
Mood Before Workout: Neutral
Mood After Workout: Fatigued

Your task is to:
1. Determine the most appropriate visualization mode for the insight, choosing from:
   - Donut chart
   - Bar chart  
   - Icon-based chart
   - Text-only with color/icon emphasis

2. Generate a single compact SVG suitable for a smartwatch screen (approximately 360x360 pixels). The SVG must be:
   - Visually clear and glanceable
   - Optimized for small screens
   - Aesthetically pleasing, with components contrasting the background
   - Self-contained (no external styles or dependencies)
   - Labeled with meaningful titles, units, or icons where appropriate
   - In the style of a visual that would be seen on a smartwatch

Focus on the user's perspective: What is most relevant for them to know at a glance right now?

Please respond with only the SVG code, starting with <svg and ending with </svg>.
